👋 Hi, I’m @SigaudMaxime  
👀 I’m interested in finance, quantitative analysis, and creating tools that simplify complex workflows for users. I’m also passionate about exploring the convergence between finance and technology, always seeking innovative solutions.

🌱 I’m currently honing my skills in back-end and front-end development, working extensively with Python, Go, Vue.js, and the latest advancements in AI for quantitative finance applications.

💞️ I’m open to collaboration, particularly on projects that aim to merge technology with user-focused design to improve accessibility and insights in finance.

📫 You can reach me on social media for any collaboration or questions!

⚡ Fun fact: I believe that automation and simplification are at the heart of all successful SaaS applications, allowing users to achieve more by doing less. Also, I’m fascinated by the mysteries of consciousness and the potential to demystify it through technology.
